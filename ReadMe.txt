Camputer:
-to change the HSV value run the python code on the camputer will you connecting to the robot, then change 
 the vaulue to 1 to start changing the HSV values, the values for HSV will be save automatic in the rasperry, 
 you can find the HSV vales in "java" directory in file named "HSV Values".

-you may have to download python to use it and also have to download Wpilib python network table.

 for all Wpilib python git: https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib
 for Wpilib python network table git: https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables
